a simple way to send messages to a discord webhook



# Installation

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

alternatively use

```pip install discordwebhooks```

# Config
the **cfg.py** file should look a little something like this

```
wh = ""
username = ""
pfp = ""
```

Change the wh variable to your webhook url

Change the username variable to whatever you would like the username to be

and change the pfp variable to a image url such as ```https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/Trollface_non-free.png/220px-Trollface_non-free.png```
